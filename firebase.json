### ðŸ§  Easy Explanation (Like to a Middle Schooler)

- Think of CI as a cookbook that tells your app how to make itself before going live.
- You added a recipe step ("static export") that doesnâ€™t work anymoreâ€”like asking a mixer to do something it can't.
- CI tries that step every time and fails, blocking the deploy.
- We just need to **take that bad step out** and CI will finish cooking your app fine.

### Next Move

1. Iâ€™ll send you the updated version of your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` without the export step.  
2. You can paste it into GitHub on mobile (Codespaces or GitHub mobile).
3. Then click **Rerun** on the CI job.  
4. CI should finish with âœ… and your changes will go liveâ€”including your `/admin` route and all mobile-accessible pages.

Let me know when you're ready for that full updated workflow!
