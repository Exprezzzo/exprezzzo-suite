# Exprezzzo Admin Sandbox Tool (Private)

This is the private admin and deployment tool for building **branded sandbox mockups** powered by the Las Vegas Good Times and Exprezzzo platform architecture. 
# Trigger deploy

## Background

This tool was originally created to support the development and pitch of:
- **Las Vegas Good Times (LVGT)** – a mobile concierge for real Las Vegas culture
- **Exprezzzo** – a white-label platform for tourism, booking, storytelling, and small business integration

It now powers the rapid creation of **demo sandboxes** for potential partners, including:
- Hotel chains (e.g., Motel 6, Clarion)
- City tourism boards (e.g., Puerto Rico, Hollywood)
- Corporations (e.g., Hugo Boss internal travel)
- StoryTime educational or cultural modules

## Key Features

- Firebase Hosting & Firestore integration
- Role-based Firebase Auth support (planned)
- GitHub Actions auto-deploy on push
- Invite-only private access
- Modular sandbox generation system

## Platform Focus

This sandbox is not for general use. It supports mockups and investor/testbed versions only.  
It does **not** include front-end apps for end users (yet).
